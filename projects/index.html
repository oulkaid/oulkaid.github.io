<p>A tool for solving Sudoku problems (up to 25x25 grid size) using two methods:
(1) mapping it to SAT clauses, by exploiting the Z3 theorem prover by Microsoft (API available for Python),
and (2) by implementing a chronological backtracking algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="risc-v-based-processor-control-flow-checking-by-signature-verification">RISC-V Based Processor Control Flow Checking By Signature Verification</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to ensure the security of programs executed on a processor based on RISC-V architecture.
The technique used consists in making comparisons between the signatures of the program (by basic blocks) at runtime
and a pre-calculated reference signature stored in memory.
From the comparison, we can say that the instructions are okay or that an error has occurred (and changed some instructions).
The platform used for the proof of concept is the PULPino project (open-source), which is written in SystemVerilog.</p>

<h2 id="real-time-dynamic-car-control-system">Real-time Dynamic Car Control System</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to implement a linear quadratic optimal control system for a dynamic model of a car (in Python),
so that it follows a certain trajectory (previously unknown).</p>
